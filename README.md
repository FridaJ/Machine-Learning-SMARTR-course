# Machine-Learning-SMARTR-course
Python project included in the SMARTR course ML part 2 (work in progress)

For the project in the course we are given a dataset with 1000 samples, to use for the development of an ML classifier (binary). The script code should then be used together with a test file with 250 samples and the output file with 0's and 1's submitted for grading. The objective is of course to get the submitted file as near 100% correct as possible.

For machine learning functions, the scikit-learn package is used.
